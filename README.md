Here is the idea, I want to make a yelp style review site.

witha few small changes, yelp tends to review companies, I want my app to review products.

My only goal is to have a functioning full review site with all revies from all people for all items

Good right? I hope so

Project log - 16/03/2021: Explained to a friend what I was doing and he replied "so... Like yelp?"
                I forgot that what I'm doing already exists...

Project log - 22/03/2021: This has quickly become a very large project for what is effectively a yelp clone.

Project log - 18/04/2021: I have taken a break from this project to review and restyle my Portfolio website. This will be done by 20/04/2021 (hopefully)
                          at which point progress will resume on this project.
