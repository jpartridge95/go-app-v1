I have inspiration, 

Imagine a review site, where you could post any and all reviews

Literally, want to review a christmas tree in july, go for it

Or a hot tub for some reason... your choice

My only goal is to have a functioning full review site with all revies from all people for all items

Good right? I hope so

Project log - 16/03/2021: Explained to a friend what I was doing and he replied "so... Like yelp?"
                I forgot that what I'm doing already exists...

Project log - 22/03/2021: This has quickly become a very large project for what is effectively a yelp clone.
