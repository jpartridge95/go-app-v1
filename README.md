Here is the idea, I want to make a yelp style review site.

witha few small changes, yelp tends to review companies, I want my app to review products.

My only goal is to have a functioning full review site with all revies from all people for all items

Good right? I hope so


# TODO

[X] Create SQL DB to interact with initially

        }
    }
}

[] Add Users and accounts API

[] Create Front End

[] Write test files

[] Deploy


# Project Log

16/03/2021: Explained to a friend what I was doing and he replied "so... Like yelp?"
                I forgot that what I'm doing already exists...


22/03/2021: This has quickly become a very large project for what is effectively a yelp clone.


18/04/2021: I have taken a break from this project to review and restyle my Portfolio website. This will be done by 20/04/2021 (hopefully). at which point progress will resume on this project.

22/04/2021: Progress Resumed on 20/04, 90% of planned endpoints have now been completed as a result
work has begun on the front end, the front end is hosted in a seperate repo, so check there for 
progress.
